Steelmesh is a __distributed application framework__ build on top of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) (specifically we love using [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.org/) community editions).

## What does it do?

Steelmesh is a curated set of Node.js packages, along with some [Sidelab](http://www.sidelab.com) built goodness to make writing distributed, reliable server-side Javascript applications repeatable.
